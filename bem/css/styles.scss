// BEM naming conventions:
// 1- Elements should be created based on the context to which they belong (ex.: li for a navigation)
// 2- Blocks are created based on context, very similar to components in react/angular
// 3- Use modifiers for theming and variances of a block/element
// 4- Be as context specific as possible with your names, ex.: "news-header" as oppose to plain "header" again following
// atomic/componentized structure.

// Make sure each component follows the BEM naming conventions for maintenance ease
// You can go as granular as needed for a pure atomic or components design

//--------- IMPORT EACH COMPONENT HERE --------//
@import 'base';
@import 'navigation';
@import 'hero';
@import 'articles';
@import 'widgets';

// In theory no styles should appear here, you should apply your styles in the specific
// atoms/components/nodes or the base
