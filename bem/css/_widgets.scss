// BEM naming conventions:
// 1- Elements should be created based on the context to which they belong (ex.: li for a navigation)
// 2- Blocks are created based on context, very similar to components in react/angular
// 3- Use modifiers for theming and variances of a block/element
// 4- Be as context specific as possible with your names, ex.: "news-header" as oppose to plain "header"
