  "manuscriptText": "We caught the tread of dancing feet,\rWe loitered down the moonlit street,\rAnd stopped beneath the harlot's house.\r\rInside, above the din and fray,\rWe heard the loud musicians play\rThe ‘Treues Liebes Herz’ of Strauss.\r\rLike strange mechanical grotesques,\rMaking fantastic arabesques,\rThe shadows raced across the blind.\r\rWe watched the ghostly dancers spin\rTo sound of horn and violin,\rLike black leaves wheeling in the wind.\r\rLike wire-pulled automatons,\rSlim silhouetted skeletons\rWent sidling through the slow quadrille,\r\rThen took each other by the hand,\rAnd danced a stately saraband;\rTheir laughter echoed thin and shrill.\r\rSometimes a clockwork puppet pressed\rA phantom lover to her breast,\rSometimes they seemed to try to sing.\r\rSometimes a horrible marionette\rCame out, and smoked its cigarette\rUpon the steps like a live thing.\r\rThen, turning to my love, I said,\r‘The dead are dancing with the dead,\rThe dust is whirling with the dust.’\r\rBut she—she heard the violin,\rAnd left my side, and entered in:\rLove passed into the house of lust.\r\rThen suddenly the tune went false,\rThe dancers wearied of the waltz,\rThe shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.\r\rAnd down the long and silent street,\rThe dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,\rCrept like a frightened girl."
