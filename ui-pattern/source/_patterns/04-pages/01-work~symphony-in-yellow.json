  "manuscriptText": "An omnibus across the bridge\rCrawls like a yellow butterfly,\rAnd, here and there, a passer-by\rShows like a little restless midge.\r\rBig barges full of yellow hay\rAre moored against the shadowy wharf,\rAnd, like a yellow silken scarf,\rThe thick fog hangs along the quay.\r\rThe yellow leaves begin to fade\rAnd flutter from the Temple elms,\rAnd at my feet the pale green Thames\rLies like a rod of rippled jade."
